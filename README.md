# 👋 Hi, I’m Bek

> “If it compiles, ship it.” – Ancient Proverb

## 🧠 About Me
- 🤖 Currently **learning AI**, pretending to understand backpropagation like it's a lifestyle.
- 🫠 Was told coding is fun. Still waiting.
- 🥇 Once debugged something by deleting the entire project and starting over. Victory.

## 🔭 Projects
- They're **somewhere** between *"just a prototype"* and *"I'll fix it later"*.  
- If it works on my machine, it’s your machine’s fault.

## 🐍 Skills
- Python (enemies with `IndentationError`)
- Jupyter (a.k.a. glorified notebooks for chaos)
- TensorFlow & PyTorch (used both, confused by both)
- Git (commits usually titled "final_final_v2_REAL_thisTime")

## 📫 Do **NOT** reach me at:
`bekhbat.davatseren@torontomu.ca`  
I’m probably ignoring my inbox anyway.
