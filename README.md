# 👋 Hi, 

> “If it compiles, ship it.” – Ancient Proverb

## About Me
- **learning AI**, pretending to understand backpropagation like it's a lifestyle.
- Was told coding is fun. Still waiting.
- Once debugged something by deleting the entire project and starting over. Victory.

## Projects
- They're **somewhere** between *"just a prototype"* and *"I'll fix it later"*.  
- If it works on my machine, it’s your machine’s fault.

## Skills
- Python (enemies with `IndentationError`)
- Jupyter (a.k.a. glorified notebooks for chaos)
- TensorFlow & PyTorch (used both, confused by both)
- Git (commits usually titled "final_final_v2_REAL_thisTime")

## Do **NOT** reach me

> Warning: May spontaneously start a side project and abandon it in 3 days.
